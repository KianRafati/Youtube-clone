*built with react.js*

### navigation bar:

For this section of the web page i have utilized numourous web components that are listed below:

1. menu button web component
2. searchbar component
3. CinePro component
4. watchlist component
5. sign in component
...

**reason :**

this website is like lego and each component is a lego piece. you can add these pieces or remove them gracefully.
Each component has encapsulated it's style using *styled-components* react library.
In doing so each component becomes recyclable and much more flexible for future uses of them.
